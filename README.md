# Finicky Link Router

This extension intercepts clicks on links and routes them through Finicky when configured to use a different browser.

## Installation

Once installed, you have to configure two settings for the extension to do anything. These options are found in the options page. In the Chrome Extensions page (chrome://extensions), find the "Finicky Link Router" extension and click "Details", and find "Extension Options" toward the bottom of the page.

1. Select the browser you have the extension installed in (what you're currently using).
2. Paste in your Finicky config and click "Save Configuration" (usually in `~/.finicky`).
